\section{Feedback}

I was not able to fill out the feedback form on moodle, therefore I'm using
this opportunity to give a short feedback to the course.

\subsection{Positive}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lecture starts at a very confortable time (9:45).
	\item The script is very good (organization, layout, depth, details).
	\item The recommended literature\footnote{The Fundamentals of Power
		Electronics by Dragan Maksimovi\'c et. al.} is very good.
		Further, its' terminology, style, and organization is similar
		to the script, hence, it is very easy to work with it.
	\item The exercises are very good. They are focused on the lectures
		contents and can be solved using the script and lecture inputs.
	\item \textbf{The exercise solutions are very good -- I'd like every
		professor to prepare such extensive solutions to the exercises}.
		One can really work on the exercise and check the detailed
		solution. \textbf{It enables a real self-study.} Further, it
		helps avoiding extensive time losses by looking for errors
		in contrast to solutions containing only a final numerical
		value.
	\item The introduction to the Plexim Software PLECS is very
		good and the use in the exercises is really helpful to get
		in touch with it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negative}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There was not much time left to discuss the exercises during the lectures.
	\item The attestations had a strong focus on control theory, which is not
		the main focus of this course. I'd rather had the opportunity to
		get more in touch with topics of the course instead.
	\item The lecture pace is rather high regarding the lecture itself and the 
		topic progress.
\end{itemize}
